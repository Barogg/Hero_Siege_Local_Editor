stats.ini infos:

name, class, level, hero level and wormhole level are not part of that list.
This file should only be used for other (less important) stats.

The order in the .ini does not matter, the list will be sorted alphabetically
by the [internalStatName]. To group certain values you can start the internal name with a number.

[1c]
[b]
[1a]

will result in

[1a]
[1c]
[b]

in the stat box.

FORCED: all those keys have to be set properly, else the whole [stat] block will be skipped.
There is no default value for these keys.

DEFAULT: only add those if your value differs from the default value to reduce PC load.

## all possible keys and = important values ##
[internalStatName]                  UNIQUE internal name only first stat of that name will load.
                                    camel case (thisIsAnExample) is used by me.
FORCED      name                    in the editor
FORCED      sectionName             in the save file @LocalAppDataDir & "\Hero_Siege\save_folder"
FORCED      keyName                 in the save file @LocalAppDataDir & "\Hero_Siege\save_folder"

shared
    DEFAULT     =0                  herosiege0.pas to herosiege17.pas depending on char slot
                =1                  shop.ini is used to save those (hero level, crystals etc.)
type
    DEFAULT     =updown             used for an integer (numbers, most stats)
                =input              used for a string (text)
                                    Any other type will cause the whole section to be skipped.
min
    DEFAULT     =0                  most stats can be 0
                                    level and MAYBE some other stats require a value > 0
                                    can be any integer from 0 to max (see below)
max
    DEFAULT     =987654321          that should be enough for any testing
                                    can be any integer from min (see above) to 987654321
                                    the hard limit of 987654321 can be changed in config.ini if needed
                                    
                                    if type=input it limits the number of characters possible
                                    Example: the character name can have 15 characters (12 ingame)
valuePrefix
    DEFAULT     =""     'empty'     Default is an empty string as most values are just numbers.
