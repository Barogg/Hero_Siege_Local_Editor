DISCLAIMER: You use that program at your own risk.

The current equipment.ini is a modified version by Nimo#0666 based on my season 8 version.

Be sure to back your save_folder at
[your user name]\AppData\Local\Hero_Siege\save_folder
up before running this program - even more important
if you edited any delivered .ini files.

And only edit .ini files if you know what you do.
Ask if you are not sure.

This editor is still in test phase and not idiot-proof.
If you want to break stuff you can.

But if you use it properly nothing should go wrong.

If you find any bugs feel free to message me on discord:

The graphical user interface (GUI) is pretty self-explaining.

The 18 'Character Slots' represent all available slots.
If that slot is empty a pyromancer is created
(out of herosiegeX.pas).

Check the 'Storage DLC purchased' checkbox if you own
the dlc to be able to save up to 200 items in one inventory.
Else if you save a character with more than 100 items he
will lose some.

I have no clue what 'Name:', 'Class:', 'Level:' and 'Wo Ho:'
do. People with an IQ below 200 should not even think about
changing those. On a serious note.
Name: up to 15 characters possible, please only use letters
        and numbers, other characters can cause conflicts.
Class: Stickman Steve is just in the list for the sake of
        completion. Will not actually be the supreme one.
Level: only accepts numbers from 1 - 100.
Wo Ho: wormhole level from 1 to 'just kill yourself'.

The 'Fill Gem Pocket' sends a WhatsApp message to Satan.
He promised me to answer every single query himself.

The 'Save Slot' button saves name, class, level,
wormhole_level and inventory_list for the active slot.
If you do changes and select another slot before pressing
this button all changes will be discarded.

The 3 comboboxes above 'Quality:' from left to right are
Type: Weapon, Shield, Helmet etc.
Subtype: currently only weapons have subtypes.
Item: all item names for a Type (and Subtype).

The 'Quality:' Updown is limited to 50 - 115.

The 'Upgrade:' Updown is limited to 1 - 10.

The 'Add' button adds an item with the previous 4 (+ subtype)
parameters.

The 'Add All' button adds all items, not just the selected.

The large listview shows the current inventory_list.
The first column is hidden and stores the full item code,
including applied runes and gems.

The 'Remove' button deletes all selected items from the
inventory_list.

The 'Remove All' button deletes all items from the
inventory_list
